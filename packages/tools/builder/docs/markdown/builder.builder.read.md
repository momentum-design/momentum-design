```

|  Parameter | Type | Description |

## Remarks

This method attempts to read files on the file system. Note that the target string will be ammended to the process execution path in order to locate the target configuration file. If the target, which aliases to the `config.definitionPath` is undefined, this method exits with the expectation that the configuration object is being mounted at the time this Builder is constructed.
