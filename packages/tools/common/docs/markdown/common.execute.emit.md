Emit a string value to CLI.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static emit(value: string): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  value | string | String value to emit to CLI. |

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

This command can only emit single string primatives, as it directly interfaces with the `process.stdout` Object instead of using the `console` Object. The decision to use `process.stdout` was made to allow the usage of this method for CI/CD workflows.
