# Common Attributes

This guide summarizes the common attributes supported across a variety of
components.

### `readonly` vs `disabled` vs `soft-disabled`

Three state attributes provide different levels of interactivity, accessibility, and intent.  
Use the following to choose the right one:

#### `readonly`
- **Focusable**: ✅ Yes
- **Visual styles**: Normal appearance (not dimmed)
- **Interactions**: Content is visible but cannot be edited. Users can still focus the field.
- **Screen Reader**: Fully accessible
- **Use when**:
  - Displaying pre-filled data the user cannot change (e.g., system IDs).
  - Locking fields temporarily while keeping their values visible.
  - Users need to focus the field to copy its value but not modify it.

#### `disabled`
- **Focusable**: ❌ No
- **Visual styles**: Dimmed/grayed out
- **Interactions**: No interaction at all (not focusable, not editable, not selectable)
- **Screen Reader**: Accessible but announced as "dimmed"
- **Use when**:
  - The input or action is not applicable in the current context.
  - You want to remove it from keyboard and screen reader navigation.
  - Example: A “Submit” button before required fields are completed.

#### `soft-disabled`
- **Focusable**: ✅ Yes
- **Visual styles**: Dimmed/grayed out
- **Interactions**: Focusable, but editing is blocked. Can display a tooltip or helper text to explain why.
- **Screen Reader**: Fully accessible
- **Use when**:
  - Input/action is temporarily unavailable but still important to discover.
  - Users need to understand why the field is unavailable (e.g., “Upgrade plan to enable”).
  - You want users to know the control exists and could become available later.

#### Design Guidance
- Use **readonly** for locked values the user must see or copy.  
- Use **disabled** to completely remove a control from the interaction flow.  
- Use **soft-disabled** when discoverability and explanation are important.  
- Always provide context (tooltip or helper text) for **soft-disabled** states.

### `auto-focus-on-mount` Attribute

This attribute is a replacement for the native `autofocus` attribute and should
be used instead.<br/> When present, it makes the component automatically focus
when it is mounted. This attribute will focus the element regardless if the
focus is already on the page or not.

The same accessibility concerns for `autofocus` apply to this attribute as well.

<br /> See MDN: [Accessibility concerns for
autofocus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus#accessibility_concerns).
