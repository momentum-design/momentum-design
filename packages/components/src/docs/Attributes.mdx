# Common Attributes

This guide summarizes the common attributes supported across a variety of
components.

### `auto-focus-on-mount` Attribute

This attribute is a replacement for the native `autofocus` attribute and should
be used instead.<br/> When present, it makes the component automatically focus
when it is mounted. This attribute will focus the element regardless if the
focus is already on the page or not.

The same accessibility concerns for `autofocus` apply to this attribute as well.
<br/> See MDN:
[Accessibility concerns for autofocus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus#accessibility_concerns).
