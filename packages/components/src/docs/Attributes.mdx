# Common Attributes

This guide summarizes the common attributes supported across a variety of
components.

### `readonly` vs `disabled` vs `soft-disabled`

Three state attributes provide different levels of interactivity and accessibility.

#### `readonly`
- **Focusable**: ✅ Yes
- **Visual styles**: Normal appearance (not dimmed)
- **Interactions**: Cannot edit content. Focusing is possible.
- **Screen Reader**: Fully accessible

#### `disabled`
- **Focusable**: ❌ No
- **Visual styles**: Dimmed/grayed out
- **Interactions**: No interactions are possible.
- **Screen Reader**: Accessible but announced as "dimmed"

#### `soft-disabled`
- **Focusable**: ✅ Yes
- **Visual styles**: Dimmed/grayed out
- **Interactions**: Focusing is available, rest of the interactions are not possible.
- **Screen Reader**: Fully accessible

### `auto-focus-on-mount` Attribute

This attribute is a replacement for the native `autofocus` attribute and should
be used instead.<br/> When present, it makes the component automatically focus
when it is mounted. This attribute will focus the element regardless if the
focus is already on the page or not.

The same accessibility concerns for `autofocus` apply to this attribute as well.

<br /> See MDN: [Accessibility concerns for
autofocus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus#accessibility_concerns).
