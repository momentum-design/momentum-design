<Title>Focus Ring</Title>

**The Focus Ring provides a visual indication of focus for users navigating via
keyboard or mouse.**

When the shared styles of the Focus Ring are applied to a component, that
component in its focus state will automatically have the focus ring wrap around
every form (like rounded corners, edges, etc.) without increasing its overall
size.

> **Note:** Currently, the Focus Ring is not exported as part of our Global Web
> Library. However, once there is an accessible component that requires the
> Focus Ring in its focus state (triggered by tab or click), the focus ring will
> wrap around that web component.

**IMPORTANT:** The Focus Ring is following the HTML standards by using
`focus-visible`, which will make the visible FocusRing appear around the button
for example only when tabbing to it, not when clicking (`document.activeElement`
will be the button in both cases). This is the standard HTML behavior and is
accessibility compliant.
