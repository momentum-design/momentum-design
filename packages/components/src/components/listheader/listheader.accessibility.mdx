## Accessibility

The `mdc-listheader` component is designed to be used within lists and menus,
providing a header that can help organize content.

Except the passed in slot content (where interactive content like buttons etc
can be passed in), everything else will be hidden from screen readers (using
`aria-hidden`) to make sure the header can be used within lists, groups and
menus without interfering.
