 * Calculates the progress arc length based on the percentage.
 *
 * The arc length is calculated using the formula:
 * Arc Length = (Percentage / 100) * Circumference - Gap Size
 *
 * Example:
 * If the circumference is 100 and the percentage is 25,
 * and there is no gap, then the progress would cover the first quarter of the circle.
 *
 * However, with a gap, the progress arc starts after a gap of gapSize / 2 at the top (12 o'clock),
 * and ends before the quarter by another gapSize / 2 (just before 3 o'clock).
 *
 * Therefore, the total arc length becomes:
 * 25% of 100 = 25
 * Subtract the two half-gaps: 25 - (2 * (gapSize / 2)) = 25 - gapSize
 *
 * For example, if gapSize is 4:
 * Final arc length = 25 - 4 = 21
 *
 * This adjustment ensures the visual gaps are maintained between the progress and the remaining track.
 *
 * @param percentage - The percentage value (0 to 100)

 * then with two gaps (one before and one after the progress arc), the calculation becomes:
 * Remaining Arc = 100 - 50 - (2 * 2) = 46
