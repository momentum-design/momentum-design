# Feature: Stepper Component Context and Integration
## Description
## User Stories
Feature: Stepper context propagation and integration
  As a developer, I want the stepper to automatically provide orientation context to connector components.
  As a user, I want the stepper to visually connect steps with connectors that reflect the current orientation.
  As a user, I want the stepper to support both horizontal and vertical layouts.
  As a user, I want the stepper to update connector orientation when the stepper orientation changes.
  As a developer, I want to ensure that connector and stepperitem components receive the correct context from the
  stepper parent.

  Scenario: Stepper provides orientation to connectors
    Given a stepper with orientation set to horizontal
    When the stepper renders connector children
    Then each connector should have orientation set to horizontal

  Scenario: Stepper provides orientation to connectors (vertical)
    Given a stepper with orientation set to vertical
    When the stepper renders connector children
    Then each connector should have orientation set to vertical

  Scenario: Stepper updates connector orientation on change
    Given a stepper with orientation set to horizontal
    When the orientation is changed to vertical
    Then all connector children should update their orientation to vertical

  Scenario: Stepper integrates stepperitem and connector visually
    Given a stepper with multiple stepperitem and connector children
    When the stepper is rendered
    Then the connectors visually connect the stepperitems according to orientation

  Scenario: Stepper accessibility
    Given a stepper with stepperitem and connector children
    When the stepper is rendered
    Then the stepper should have appropriate ARIA roles and attributes for navigation
