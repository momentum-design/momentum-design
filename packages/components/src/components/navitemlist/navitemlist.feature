Feature: NavItemList Container and Navigation Management

  Background:
    Given the NavItemList component is rendered on the page
    And the navitemlist extends MenuBar functionality
    And the navitemlist has role="menubar"
    And the navitemlist is focusable with proper ARIA attributes
    And the navitemlist contains:
      | Property         | Value              | State    |
      | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
      | ARIA Label       | accessibility text | Optional |
      | SideNav Context  | provider context   | Internal |
      | NavItems         | child components   | Slotted  |

  Rule: ✅ Container Structure and Layout

    Scenario: Render navitemlist with multiple navitems
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple mdc-navitem elements
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then all navitems should be properly organized
      And the navitemlist should maintain proper spacing and alignment
      And the navitemlist should have role="menubar"

    Scenario: Render navitemlist with mixed content
      Given the navitemlist contains navitems, dividers, and text headers
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then all content should be properly displayed
      And the navitemlist structure should be maintained

    Scenario: Render empty navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist contains no child elements
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then the navitemlist should be visible
      And it should maintain proper ARIA structure

  Rule: ✅ Event Handling and Communication

    Scenario: Handle activechange event from nested navitem
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple navitems
      And one navitem has nav-id "item-1"
      When the navitem with nav-id "item-1" emits an activechange event
      Then the navitemlist should capture the event
      And the navitemlist should communicate with SideNavigation context
      And the SideNavigation should update the current active nav item

    Scenario: Event propagation through navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist is within a SideNavigation
      And the navitemlist contains a navitem
      When the navitem emits an activechange event
      Then the event should bubble up through the navitemlist
      And the SideNavigation should receive the event details
      And the SideNavigation should set the correct active nav item

    Scenario: Event handling for disabled navitems
      Given the navitemlist contains both enabled and disabled navitems
      When a disabled navitem interaction occurs
      Then the navitemlist should not process activechange events from disabled items
      And the SideNavigation context should remain unchanged

  Rule: ✅ Accessibility and ARIA

    Scenario: Default ARIA attributes for navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist is rendered
      Then the navitemlist should have role="menubar"
      And the navitemlist should inherit proper MenuBar ARIA attributes
      And the navitemlist should be focusable for keyboard navigation

    Scenario: Custom ARIA label for navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist has aria-label set to "Main Navigation"
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then the navitemlist should have aria-label="Main Navigation"
      And screen readers should announce the custom label

  Rule: ✅ Keyboard Navigation

    Scenario: Tab navigation through navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple focusable navitems
      When I navigate using Tab key
      Then focus should move through enabled navitems in order
      And disabled navitems should be skipped
      And the navitemlist should manage focus properly

    Scenario: Arrow key navigation within navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist is focused
      And the navitemlist contains multiple navitems
      When I press arrow keys (Up/Down)
      Then focus should move between navitems
      And the navitemlist should follow MenuBar navigation patterns

    Scenario: Home and End key navigation
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple navitems
      And focus is on a middle navitem
      When I press "Home" key
      Then focus should move to the first enabled navitem
      When I press "End" key
      Then focus should move to the last enabled navitem

  Rule: ✅ Content Management

    Scenario: NavItems collection management
      Given the navitemlist contains various child elements
      When the navitemlist queries for navitems
      Then it should return only mdc-navitem elements
      And disabled navitems should be excluded from the collection
      And the collection should be updated when children change

    Scenario: Finding navitem by nav-id
      Given the navitemlist contains navitems with different nav-ids
      When searching for a navitem with nav-id "item-3"
      Then the navitemlist should return the correct navitem
      And the search should be case-sensitive and exact match

    Scenario: Handling navitems without nav-id
      Given the navitemlist contains navitems without nav-id
      When processing activechange events
      Then the navitemlist should handle missing nav-ids gracefully
      And no errors should be thrown

  Rule: ✅ Performance and Lifecycle

    Scenario: Efficient event listener management
      Given the navitemlist is connected to the DOM
      When the navitemlist is connected
      Then it should add activechange event listeners
      When the navitemlist is disconnected
      Then it should remove all event listeners properly
      And no memory leaks should occur

  Rule: ✅ Integration with MenuBar

    Scenario: MenuBar functionality inheritance
      Given the navitemlist extends MenuBar
      When the navitemlist is used
      Then it should inherit all MenuBar keyboard navigation
      And it should maintain MenuBar ARIA patterns
      And it should support MenuBar event handling

  Rule: ✅ Error Handling

    Scenario: Handle missing SideNavigation context gracefully
      Given the navitemlist is rendered without SideNavigation context
      When activechange events occur
      Then the navitemlist should not throw errors
      And it should continue functioning with basic behavior

    Scenario: Handle malformed activechange events
      Given the navitemlist receives an activechange event
      And the event has missing or invalid nav-id
      When processing the event
      Then the navitemlist should handle the error gracefully
      And the application should remain stable
