    Given the NavItemList component is rendered on the page
    And the navitemlist extends MenuBar functionality
    And the navitemlist has role="menubar"
    And the navitemlist is focusable with proper ARIA attributes
    And the navitemlist contains:
      | Property         | Value              | State    |
      | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
      | Show Label       | true/false         | Required |
      | ARIA Label       | accessibility text | Optional |
      | SideNav Context  | provider context   | Internal |
      | NavItems         | child components   | Slotted  |

  Rule: ✅ Container Structure and Layout

    Scenario: Render navitemlist with multiple navitems
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple mdc-navitem elements
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then all navitems should be properly organized
      And the navitemlist should maintain proper spacing and alignment
      And the navitemlist should have role="menubar"

    Scenario: Render navitemlist in expanded state
      Given the navitemlist has show-label set to true
      And the navitemlist contains navitems with labels
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then all navitem labels should be visible
      And the navitemlist should accommodate full-width layout

    Scenario: Render navitemlist in collapsed state
      Given the navitemlist has show-label set to false
      And the navitemlist contains navitems
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then navitem labels should be hidden
      And only icons should be visible
      And the navitemlist should use compact layout

    Scenario: Render navitemlist with mixed content
      Given the navitemlist contains navitems, text headers, and dividers
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then all elements should be properly positioned
      And section headers should be displayed correctly
      And dividers should separate sections appropriately

    Scenario: Render empty navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist has no child elements
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then the navitemlist should render without errors
      And the container should maintain proper structure

  Rule: ✅ SideNavigation Context Integration

    Scenario: NavItemList responds to SideNavigation expansion state
      Given the navitemlist is within a SideNavigation context
      And the SideNavigation is expanded
      When the context updates
      Then the navitemlist show-label should be set to true
      And all nested navitems should display labels

    Scenario: NavItemList responds to SideNavigation collapse state
      Given the navitemlist is within a SideNavigation context
      And the SideNavigation is collapsed
      When the context updates
      Then the navitemlist show-label should be set to false
      And all nested navitems should hide labels

    Scenario: NavItemList without SideNavigation context
      Given the navitemlist is rendered without SideNavigation context
      When the navitemlist is updated
      Then the navitemlist should maintain its current show-label state
      And no context-dependent updates should occur

  Rule: ✅ Event Handling and Communication

    Scenario: Handle activechange event from nested navitem
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple navitems
      And one navitem has nav-id "item-1"
      When the navitem with nav-id "item-1" emits an activechange event
      Then the navitemlist should capture the event
      And the navitemlist should communicate with SideNavigation context
      And the SideNavigation should update the current active nav item

    Scenario: Event propagation through navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist is within a SideNavigation
      And the navitemlist contains a navitem
      When the navitem emits an activechange event
      Then the event should bubble up through the navitemlist
      And the SideNavigation should receive the event details
      And the SideNavigation should set the correct active nav item

    Scenario: Handle activechange from multiple navitemlists
      Given multiple navitemlists exist within the same SideNavigation
      And each navitemlist contains different navitems
      When any navitem emits an activechange event
      Then only the parent navitemlist should handle the event
      And the SideNavigation should receive the correct nav item reference

    Scenario: Event handling for disabled navitems
      Given the navitemlist contains both enabled and disabled navitems
      When a disabled navitem interaction occurs
      Then the navitemlist should not process activechange events from disabled items
      And the SideNavigation context should remain unchanged

  Rule: ✅ Accessibility and ARIA

    Scenario: Default ARIA attributes for navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist is rendered
      Then the navitemlist should have role="menubar"
      And the navitemlist should inherit proper MenuBar ARIA attributes
      And the navitemlist should be focusable for keyboard navigation

    Scenario: Custom ARIA label for navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist has aria-label set to "Main Navigation"
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then the navitemlist should have aria-label="Main Navigation"
      And screen readers should announce the custom label

    Scenario: ARIA attributes in expanded state
      Given the navitemlist is in expanded state
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then the navitemlist should maintain proper ARIA structure
      And nested navitems should have appropriate ARIA attributes

    Scenario: ARIA attributes in collapsed state
      Given the navitemlist is in collapsed state
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then the navitemlist should maintain proper ARIA structure
      And accessibility should be preserved despite hidden labels

  Rule: ✅ Keyboard Navigation

    Scenario: Tab navigation through navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple focusable navitems
      When I navigate using Tab key
      Then focus should move through enabled navitems in order
      And disabled navitems should be skipped
      And the navitemlist should manage focus properly

    Scenario: Arrow key navigation within navitemlist
      Given the navitemlist is focused
      And the navitemlist contains multiple navitems
      When I press arrow keys (Up/Down)
      Then focus should move between navitems
      And the navitemlist should follow MenuBar navigation patterns

    Scenario: Home and End key navigation
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple navitems
      And focus is on a middle navitem
      When I press "Home" key
      Then focus should move to the first enabled navitem
      When I press "End" key
      Then focus should move to the last enabled navitem

    Scenario: Enter and Space key activation
      Given a navitem within the navitemlist is focused
      When I press "Enter" or "Space" key
      Then the focused navitem should be activated
      And an activechange event should be emitted
      And the navitemlist should handle the event appropriately

  Rule: ✅ Content Management

    Scenario: NavItems collection management
      Given the navitemlist contains various child elements
      When the navitemlist queries for navitems
      Then it should return only mdc-navitem elements
      And disabled navitems should be excluded from the collection
      And the collection should be updated when children change

    Scenario: Finding navitem by nav-id
      Given the navitemlist contains navitems with different nav-ids
      When searching for a navitem with nav-id "item-3"
      Then the navitemlist should return the correct navitem
      And the search should be case-sensitive and exact match

    Scenario: Handling navitems without nav-id
      Given the navitemlist contains navitems without nav-id
      When processing activechange events
      Then the navitemlist should handle missing nav-ids gracefully
      And no errors should be thrown

  Rule: ✅ Responsive Behavior

    Scenario: NavItemList adapts to container width changes
      Given the navitemlist is rendered in a responsive container
      When the container width changes
      Then the navitemlist should adapt its layout accordingly
      And navitems should maintain proper alignment

    Scenario: NavItemList in different viewport sizes
      Given the navitemlist is rendered on different screen sizes
      When the viewport changes from desktop to mobile
      Then the navitemlist should maintain accessibility
      And touch interactions should work properly

  Rule: ✅ Performance and Lifecycle

    Scenario: Efficient event listener management
      Given the navitemlist is connected to the DOM
      When the navitemlist is connected
      Then it should add activechange event listeners
      When the navitemlist is disconnected
      Then it should remove all event listeners properly
      And no memory leaks should occur

    Scenario: Context subscription management
      Given the navitemlist subscribes to SideNavigation context
      When the component lifecycle changes
      Then context subscriptions should be managed properly
      And context updates should trigger appropriate re-renders

  Rule: ✅ Integration with MenuBar

    Scenario: MenuBar functionality inheritance
      Given the navitemlist extends MenuBar
      When the navitemlist is used
      Then it should inherit all MenuBar keyboard navigation
      And it should maintain MenuBar ARIA patterns
      And it should support MenuBar event handling

    Scenario: MenuBar styling and layout
      Given the navitemlist uses MenuBar styles
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then it should apply proper MenuBar layout
      And custom navitemlist styles should enhance the base styles

  Rule: ✅ Error Handling

    Scenario: Handle missing SideNavigation context gracefully
      Given the navitemlist is rendered without SideNavigation context
      When activechange events occur
      Then the navitemlist should not throw errors
      And it should continue functioning with basic behavior

    Scenario: Handle malformed activechange events
      Given the navitemlist receives an activechange event
      And the event has missing or invalid nav-id
      When processing the event
      Then the navitemlist should handle the error gracefully
      And the application should remain stable

    Scenario: Handle DOM changes during event processing
      Given the navitemlist is processing an activechange event
      When DOM structure changes during processing
      Then the navitemlist should handle the changes gracefully
      And event processing should complete safely

  Rule: ✅ Visual States and Styling

    Scenario: NavItemList maintains consistent visual hierarchy
      Given the navitemlist contains navitems with different states
      When the navitemlist is rendered
      Then visual hierarchy should be clear and consistent
      And spacing between elements should be uniform

    Scenario: NavItemList in different themes
      Given the navitemlist is rendered with different color themes
      When theme changes occur
      Then the navitemlist should adapt to theme changes
      And all child navitems should reflect the new theme

  Rule: ✅ Screen Reader Accessibility

    Scenario: VoiceOver announces navitemlist structure
      Given the navitemlist contains multiple navitems
      When VoiceOver navigates to the navitemlist
      Then VoiceOver should announce "menu bar"
      And VoiceOver should announce the aria-label if provided
      And VoiceOver should indicate the number of menu items

    Scenario: VoiceOver navigation within navitemlist
      Given VoiceOver is focused on the navitemlist
      When VoiceOver navigates through navitems
      Then each navitem should be announced with its role
      And the position within the list should be indicated
      And disabled items should be announced as disabled

    Scenario: VoiceOver announces state changes
      Given VoiceOver is monitoring the navitemlist
      When navitem active states change
      Then VoiceOver should announce the state changes
      And users should be informed of the current active item
