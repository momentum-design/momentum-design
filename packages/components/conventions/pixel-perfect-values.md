# Usage of Pixel Perfect values in momentum-design components

## Purpose

To ensure our components align with design specifications exactly as outlined in Figma, achieving pixel-perfect styling and consistency across the application.

## Styling Guidelines

### 1. Exact Heights, Sizes, and Spacing
- Match the exact padding, margin, and layout dimensions from Figma to maintain visual consistency. 
- **Height**: Use the exact height only when specified by a variant (e.g., specific button size variants). In other cases, the height can remain flexible to respond to content or context.
- **Width**: Allow the width to adjust based on the content provided, unless a variant specifies a fixed width.
- Always inspect designs carefully, paying attention to even the smallest details to ensure every layout and dimension aligns with the Figma blueprint.
- Technical breakdowns should clarify whether the height or width should be fixed or content-dependent, based on each componentâ€™s unique requirements.

### 2. Pixel-Perfect Approach
- All components should replicate Figma specifications to a pixel-perfect level, ensuring a visually consistent user experience.
- Perform cross-browser checks to maintain uniformity across various environments.

### 3. Rounding of `rem` Values
- **Rounding Strategy**: Avoid unnecessary rounding. Only round `rem` values if there are excessive decimal places (e.g., `3.333333` may be rounded to `3.33334`). Precise values are preferred for accuracy and consistency.
- **Conversion Convention**: Follow `px` to `rem` conversions according to the px-to-rem unit standard.
- **Example**: If Figma specifies `30px`, convert it using the base rem value (e.g., `30px / 16 = 1.875rem`). Avoid rounding unless decimal values are excessive.

### 4. Detail-Oriented Execution
- Attention to detail is critical. Confirm that component borders, shadows, line heights, font sizes, and other small but significant design elements reflect the design spec.
- Regularly validate component styles with Figma to catch any discrepancies early.

### 5. Documentation of Changes
- Document any intentional deviations from Figma specifications, with the reason and approval details, to ensure transparency and track design choices.

This convention ensures each component remains faithful to the design while allowing a smooth transition to tokenized layouts. Let's keep refining these practices as we integrate more components!
