# CSS Styling Convention: Using `rem` Instead of `px`

## Introduction

This document outlines the convention of using `rem` units instead of `px` units in CSS styling within our project. The goal is to ensure consistency, scalability, and accessibility across all components.

## What is `rem`?

`rem` stands for "root em" and is a relative unit of measurement in CSS. It is based on the font size of the root element (`<html>`). Unlike `em`, which is relative to the font size of its nearest parent, `rem` is always relative to the root font size, providing a more predictable and consistent scaling factor.

### Example

If the root font size is set to 16px:

- `1rem` equals 16px
- `2rem` equals 32px
- `0.5rem` equals 8px

This consistency makes `rem` a powerful tool for responsive design and accessibility.

## Why Use `rem`?

### 1. Scalability

- **Responsive Design**: `rem` units are relative to the root element (`<html>`), making it easier to scale the entire layout by changing the root font size.
- **Consistency**: Using `rem` ensures that all elements scale proportionally, maintaining design integrity across different screen sizes and resolutions.

### 2. Accessibility

- **User Preferences**: `rem` respects user settings for font sizes in their browsers, enhancing accessibility for users with visual impairments.
- **Better Readability**: By adhering to user-defined font sizes, `rem` units contribute to better readability and user experience.
- **Zooming**: Browsers handle zoom levels more gracefully with `rem` units. When a user zooms in, elements sized with `rem` units will scale more consistently compared to `px` units, improving the user experience.



### 3. Maintainability

- **Simplified Calculations**: With `rem`, you can avoid complex calculations and conversions between different units, making the CSS easier to maintain.
- **Global Changes**: Adjusting the root font size allows for quick global changes to the entire design, reducing the need for extensive modifications.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Set a Base Font Size**:  It is important to clarify that this is an action to be taken by the application or consumer, and that the our (Momentum Design) team should not set the base font size within our components.

    ```css
    html {
         font-size: 16px; /* This can be adjusted based on design requirements */
    }
    ```

2. **Use `rem` for Sizing**:

    ```css
    .example {
         font-size: 1.5rem; /* 1.5 * 16px = 24px */
         padding: 1rem;    /* 1 * 16px = 16px */
         margin: 2rem;     /* 2 * 16px = 32px */
    }
    ```

3. **Avoid Using `px` Directly**:
    - We should refrain from using `px` unless absolutely necessary. Any instances where `px` might be required should be discussed prior to implementation.

## Conclusion

Adopting `rem` units in our CSS styling promotes a more scalable, accessible, and maintainable codebase. By following this convention, we ensure a consistent and user-friendly design across all components.
