# Type-Only Imports in TypeScript

With the introduction of TypeScript 3.8, type-only imports have become a recommended practice for managing type declarations in your code. This documentation explains what type-only imports are, why they should be used, and provides guidelines for their implementation.

## What Are Type-Only Imports?

Type-only imports allow you to import declarations solely for type annotations and declarations without including any runtime values. The syntax for a type-only import is as follows:

```js
import type { SomeType } from './some-module';
```

This statement imports `SomeType` only for use in type contexts, and it will be completely erased during the transpilation process, leaving no trace at runtime.

### Key Features

- **No Runtime Impact:** Type-only imports do not generate any code in the output JavaScript, which helps reduce bundle size.
- **Clarity of Intent:** Using import type clearly indicates that the imported declaration is intended solely for type-checking purposes.

## Why Use Type-Only Imports?

### 1. Improved Code Clarity

Using import type enhances code readability by making it clear to developers that certain imports are only relevant at compile time. This reduces confusion about which imports are necessary for runtime behavior and which are not.

### 2. Reduced Bundle Size

Since type-only imports are erased during compilation, they help decrease the final bundle size of your application. This is particularly beneficial when working with large modules or libraries.

### 3. Avoiding Unnecessary Imports

When you import dependent components directly within a class (e.g., `import { SomeComponent } from './SomeComponent';`), it can lead to unnecessary imports if the class is extended elsewhere. For instance, if a component that extends another component inadvertently brings in all its dependencies, it can bloat the final output with unused code.

By using type-only imports, you ensure that only the necessary types are imported without any associated values, preventing potential issues with unnecessary dependencies in extended components.

### 4. Compatibility with Transpilers

Type-only imports are especially useful when working with transpilers like Babel or SWC that may not have access to TypeScript's type information. By explicitly marking an import as a type, you inform these tools that they can safely omit it from the final output.

## Usage Guidelines

```js
// Don't use
import { SomeType } from "./some-module"; // Imports both types and values;

// Use this
import type { SomeType } from "./some-module"; // Only imports types
```

Here's how to implement type-only imports effectively:

```js
// user.ts
export interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

// app.ts
import type { User } from './user'; // Importing User interface as a type only

function createUser(userData: User) {
    console.log(`Name: ${userData.name}, Age: ${userData.age}`);
}

const user1: User = { name: "Pankaj", age: 20 };
createUser(user1);
```

In this example, the `User` interface is imported solely for type-checking purposes without affecting runtime behavior.

## Conclusion

Adopting type-only imports is a best practice that enhances code clarity, reduces bundle size, and prevents unnecessary dependencies from being included in your application. As TypeScript continues to evolve, leveraging features like `import type` will lead to cleaner and more maintainable codebases. Embrace this practice in your projects to ensure efficient and effective TypeScript development!
