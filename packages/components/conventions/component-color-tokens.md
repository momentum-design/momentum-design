# Usage of color tokens in momentum-design components

In the Momentum Design System, it is essential to always use color tokens when defining colors within our components. This practice ensures consistency, accessibility, and a cohesive visual identity across all applications.

## Token Definitions

We have defined color tokens that can be found at the following link: [Momentum Design Tokens](https://momentum-design.github.io/momentum-design/en/tokens/theme-stable/). These tokens serve as the standardized color palette for all components.

## Guidelines for Using Color Tokens

1. **Consistent Usage**: Always utilize the defined theme and color tokens in your component designs. Avoid using custom colors or any values outside the provided tokens.
1. **Component Specifications**: Ensure that every component specification includes a corresponding color token. This will help maintain uniformity and facilitate easier updates in the future.
1. **Avoid Anomalies**: There should never be instances of using colors that are not defined in the token library. This helps prevent discrepancies and ensures that all components adhere to the design system.

## Conclusion

Adhering to the practice of using theme and color tokens within the Momentum Design System is crucial for maintaining consistency and ease of maintenance across our components. By ensuring every component specification references these tokens, we foster a cohesive design language that enhances both the developer experience and end-user satisfaction.
