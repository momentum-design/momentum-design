# Testing

## E2E Testing

`@momentum-design/components` utilizes [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as
the core end-to-end testing framework to ensure continuous functionality during
development. Our e2e tests focus on functionality rather than code coverage to
strike a balance between quick feedback and usability.

### Scope

- Testing visual consistency of a component
- Does the component display correctly in x browser (consistency and
  responsiveness)?
- Are attributes and methods useable as expected in x browser?
- Does the components functions work correctly in x browser?
- Is the component accessible in x browser?
- Are interactions with the component working as expected in x browser?

### Browser List to test

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari/webkit

#### Setup

`@momentum-design/components` project performs visual comparisons and
functionality testing for all components. There are different setups for local
environments versus GitHub Workflow:

- On Local:
  - You can run functional tests locally (for easier debugging) or in Docker.
  - Update snapshot images (golden images) only using Docker or Podman with the
    official Playwright image, via the provided yarn scripts.
  - Uses `playwright.config.ts`, relying on local and a web server.
- On Github Workflow:
  - GitHub Workflow build the Playwright Docker image to run all tests,
    including snapshot tests.
- Playwright projects:
  - Default = Functional tests and Snapshot tests (Docker required)
  - Skip Snapshot = Snapshot tests (Recommend for local)

### Local development

For the best local development experience, the following E2E setup testing is
recommended:

1. In the terminal, run:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:install # install all browsers for playwright to run on local
     # you don't have to install if you already have them
   ```

2. Once the install completes, setup the webserver:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:serve # setup server on localhost:4000
   ```

3. Open another terminal, now you can start the test:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:skip-snapshot # without snapshot
     # if you want to test the snapshot, please see Docker Testing
   ```

   - To run the tests in `headed mode`, run:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:skip-snapshot -- --headed # without snapshot
   ```

4. To Run **single** E2E Test file, run:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:skip-snapshot XXX.e2e-test.ts # without snapshot
   ```

5. To Run **individual** test case in a test file, run:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:skip-snapshot -- './src/components/iconprovider/iconprovider.e2e-test.ts' -g 'mdc-IconProvider nested'
   ```

   - where the test file is
     `"./src/components/iconprovider/iconprovider.e2e-test.ts"`, while within
     the file, the test naming structure is `mdc-IconProvider nested`.

6. To Run test in **specific** browser, run:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:chrome # run on chrome whithout snapshots
     yarn components test:e2e:firefox # run on firefox whithout snapshots
   ```

### Update Visual Regression snapshots

To update Visual Regression snapshots, follow the steps below to run E2E testing
on Docker. To quickly execute it in VSCode, use the VSCode Task
`Components E2E Docker Tests` for Docker.

1. You need to have os of the container solution installed on your local
   machine:

- **Docker**
  > Make sure you have the appropriate license for Docker Desktop before you use
  > it, or get Podman instead.
- **[Podman](https://podman.io/)**

  > It advised to add `alias docker=podman` to your shell config file, e.g.
  > ~/.zshrc)

2. **Docker engine / daemon needs to run before executing.** OR **Podman machine
   needs to be run before executing**

3. Login to the ghcr.io:

   ```bash
    echo $PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u username --password-stdin # login to docker with your github credentials (replace $PAT with personal access token (access token needs write packages access))
   ```

4. Open a terminal to set up webserver:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:serve # setup server on localhost:4000
   ```

5. Open another terminal to run docker image:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:docker:serve # run docker image on localhost:3000
   ```

   or if you're using podman:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:podman:serve # run podman image on localhost:3000
   ```

6. Open another terminal to start run the test:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:docker # run all the e2e test
     yarn components test:e2e:docker:update-snapshot # update snapshots
   ```

7. To Run **single** E2E Test file, run:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:docker XXX.e2e-test.ts
     yarn components test:e2e:docker:update-snapshot XXX.e2e-test.ts # update snapshots
   ```

8. To update snapshots for a **single** E2E Test in **specific** browser, run:

   ```bash
     yarn components test:e2e:docker:update-snapshot:chrome XXX.e2e-test.ts # run only on chrome with update snapshots
     yarn components test:e2e:docker:update-snapshot:firefox XXX.e2e-test.ts # run only on firefox with update snapshots
     yarn components test:e2e:docker:update-snapshot:webkit XXX.e2e-test.ts # run only on webkit with update snapshots
     yarn components test:e2e:docker:update-snapshot:msedge XXX.e2e-test.ts # run only on msedge with update snapshots
   ```

### Update Visual Regression snapshots using GitHub Actions Workflow

If you're experiencing inconsistencies with Docker on your local system, you can use the GitHub Actions workflow to update snapshots. This workflow runs in a consistent Docker environment and automatically commits the updated snapshots to your branch.

#### Important Prerequisites

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Always run this workflow on your **forked repository** (origin), not directly on the main momentum-design repository. The workflow is designed to work with your fork and will typically fail if run on the main repository.

#### Initial Setup

Before you can use the workflow, you need to set up a GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) token:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)** (if you don't already have one):
   
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Generate a new token with `write:packages` access
   - Save the token value securely (you'll need it in the next step)

2. **Add the token as a repository secret**:
   
   - Go to your **forked repository** on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - **Name**: `GHCR_TOKEN` (must match this exact name)
   - **Secret**: Paste your Personal Access Token value
   - Click "Add secret"

> **Note**: This is the same Personal Access Token you use for Docker login in your terminal when following the local Docker testing steps.

#### Running the Workflow

1. **Navigate to Actions tab** in your forked repository

2. **Select the workflow**:
   - Click on "Update Visual Regression Snapshots" from the workflow list

3. **Run the workflow**:
   - Click the "Run workflow" dropdown button
   - Select the branch you want to update snapshots for (e.g., `test-menuitem`)
   - **Component name** (optional): 
     - Leave empty to update all components
     - Specify one component: `menuitem`
     - Specify multiple components: `menuitem menusection`
   - **Other arguments** (optional): Any additional arguments you want to pass to the update command
   - Click "Run workflow" to start

4. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - The workflow will pull the Docker image from GHCR
   - Run the snapshot update process
   - Check for any missing or outdated snapshots
   - Commit and push the changes automatically

5. **Review the changes**:
   - Once the workflow completes successfully, a commit will be pushed by `github-actions[bot]`
   - The commit message will be: `chore: updated snapshots for component [component-name]`
   - Review the updated snapshot files in your branch

#### Testing method

```bash
  # E2E test methods
  yarn components test:e2e:skip-snapshot # you should run this on local, test are filter test base on snapshot condition check
  yarn components test:e2e # the general playwright script for local to run
  yarn components test:e2e:install # install all the browsers dependencies to local
  yarn components test:e2e:chrome # runs all test on specific browser, without snapshot
  yarn components test:e2e:report # shows the previous test report (also work for docker test)

  yarn components test:e2e:docker:build # build docker image that required for testing (can pull from GHCR)
  yarn components test:e2e:docker:serve # run Playwright server in docker image to run the test
  yarn components test:e2e:docker # the general playwright script for docker to run (Follow Docker Testing Instruction)
  yarn components test:e2e:docker:update-snapshot # build and update snapshots (Only works if docker is installed)
```

#### Other ways of running tests

- Using UI Mode - by running `yarn components test:e2e:ui` a separate browser
  window will be available, which allows you to control the running of tests
  from there
- Using
  [Playwright VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)

#### Note on Docker Perfomance on Mac (M Series)

Since Docker runs on the `amd64` architecture, using Docker on Mac with M chips
may result in slower performance due to the emulation layer provided by
Rosetta 2. For faster performance, it's recommended to run Docker in a native
`amd64` environment or be aware of the potential delays when running locally on
Mac.

### Upload Latest Version of Docker Playwright Image

1. Replace the existence of `v1.49.1` to the latest version of playwright in the
   `Dockerfile.test.postbuild` file, .github/workflows/update-snapshots.yml,
   packages/components/package.json.

1. Install this latest version with `yarn`

1. You need to have docker installed on local.

1. Set the version to latest playwright version and build the new image to local
   :

   ```bash
     "yarn components test:e2e:docker:build": "docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f ./config/playwright/docker/utils/Dockerfile.test.postbuild -t ghcr.io/momentum-design/momentum-design/docker-playwright:v1.49.1 ."
     # replace all the v1.49.1 to the latest version of playwright and run this script to build new image
   ```

1. After the build is done, login to the docker ghcr.io:

   ```bash
    echo $PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u username --password-stdin # login to docker with you github credentials (replace $PAT with personal access token (access token needs write packages access))
   ```

1. Now you can push the latest image to GHCR:

   ```bash
     docker push ghcr.io/momentum-design/momentum-design/docker-playwright:v1.49.1
     # replace the v1.49.1 to the version you want to push
   ```

1. You can check the image that you push here
   [Docker-Playwright](https://github.com/orgs/momentum-design/packages/container/package/momentum-design%2Fdocker-playwright)

1. Note: After the playwright version and docker image is update, all the
   snapshots need to be updated and re-generated.
