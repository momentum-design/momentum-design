### Calculating Foreground Color

We have created a utils function to calculate forground color. Use the following steps to run the static site to test the forground color and check its contrast ratio.
Run `yarn` at the root level of momentum-design to install all the dependencies.
Run `yarn utils dev` to start the local server.
