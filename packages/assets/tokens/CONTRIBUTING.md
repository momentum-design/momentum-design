This package is fully maintained by the **Momentum Design Designers** and should not have any of its source content modified directly. The files within `./config` can be modified to allow for additional outputs to be generated based on its contents. If additional outputs outside of the supported outputs should be generated, please refer to the [@momentum-design/token-builder](https://github.com/momentum-design/momentum-design/tree/main/packages/%40momentum-design/token-builder) package.
