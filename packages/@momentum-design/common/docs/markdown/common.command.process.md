## Remarks

This method should be implemented in class definitions that extend this class. The scope of this method is to process params interpreted from the provided CLI execution. This can return any data transfer Object, as the return is intended to be used within `Command.prepare()`<!-- -->. Since this can require async operation, the override method must return a Promise for API consistency.
