Initialize this Builder.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
initialize(): Promise<this>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;this&gt;

- This Builder after executing this method.

## Remarks

This method calls `this.generateBuilders()` in order to construct Builder class Objects within its scope. After all Builder class Objects are generated, it attempts to initialize all Builder class Objects before resolving to this Builders class Object.
